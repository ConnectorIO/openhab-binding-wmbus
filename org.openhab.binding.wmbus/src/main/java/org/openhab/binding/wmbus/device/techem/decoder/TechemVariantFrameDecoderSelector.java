/**
 * Frame decoder which passes actual work to delegate after confirming matching device variant.
 *
 * Since Techem devices tend to use very similar wmbus identification and most of them reports themselves as RESERVED we
 * need to determine its type based on device version. This decoder reads byte at fixed, given position and then try to
 * match given decoders with it.
 * Since standard leaves space for vendor specific device types this type is an attempt to sort it in a way which does
 * not interfere with actual frame decoding logic.
 * Tag offset is calculated from end of address field which contains manufacturer, device id, device version and device
 * type. Value -1 passed to constructor indicates that variant determination is based on device version while value 0
 * points to last byte in address which is device type.
